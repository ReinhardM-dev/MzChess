MzChess
===========================
A chess GUI using PyQt5 and `chess`_ modules.

Installing
----------

If youâ€™re on Linux, you should install
the binary packages *PyQt5*, *PyQt5.QtChart*, and - if available - *PyQt5.QtSvg* using
the `Linux Package Manager`_ to avoid a compilation of the huge sources. 
Then, download and install the latest release:

::

    pip install mzChess
    
Running
----------

An executable is generated and installed in python's *Scripts* directory. 
So, if this directory is in your search *PATH*, you type simply

::

    mzChess

to start the GUI. A little helper

::

   buildFen
   
allows to build position strings using the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (`FEN`_)
and copy them to the clipboard.
