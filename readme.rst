MzChess: a chess GUI using PyQt6 and `chess`_ modules
==========================================================

The chess GUI allows for:

 * play standard chess games
 * configure the game header
 * load and/or save games and/or databases with many games
 * configure and run Universal Chess Interface (`UCI`_) engines
 * detects Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (`ECO`_)
 * annotates games or single moves
 * shows score graphs
 * allows to monitor scores and move hints continously (for training purposes)
 * allows to warn on danger (for training purposes)
 * allows to show move options (for training purposes)

It supports the following game formats:

 * Portable Game Notation (`PGN`_) standard
 * Pickled PGN (*PPNG*), an internal format for rapid loading

Installing
--------------

Mz Chess is based on Python 3.7+.

.. warning::
 
 If youâ€™re not on Windows, you are responsible for the installation of the binary PyQt-packages, i.e.

  * *PyQt6*, *PyQt6.QtCharts* (v6.2+)
  * or *PyQt5*, *PyQt5.QtChart*, and - if available - *PyQt5.QtSvg* (v5.11+),

 using a `Linux Package Manager`_, `Homebrew`_ or pip3 in advance. 
 Linux users planning a pip3 installation should consult the `manylinux`_ webpage 
 to see whether their distribution is supported.
 
Then, download and install the latest release:

::

    pip install mzChess
    
If you are under Windows or Linux, you can run 

::

    <python> -c "import MzChess; MzChess.postInstall()"  

to get symbolic links to the tools *mzChess* and *fenBuild* on the desktop 
(*<python>* is the python interpreter used for installation).
Under Windows, the *postInstall* function must be executed as administrator.

Running the GUI
-----------------------

An executable is generated and installed in python's *Scripts* directory. 
So, if this directory is in your search *PATH*, you type simply

::

    mzChess

to start the GUI. A little helper

::

   buildFen
   
allows to build position strings using the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (`FEN`_)
and copy them to the clipboard.
